# Flax Indoor Greenhouse Simulation

This Python program simulates a control system for an indoor greenhouse designed specifically for growing flax plants (linen fiber for clothing fabrics). The simulation models plant growth through all phases - germination, growth, flowering, and ripening - while controlling and monitoring environmental conditions.

## Features

- **Complete Plant Life Cycle Simulation**: Models the entire growth cycle of flax plants through germination, growth, flowering, and ripening phases
- **Environmental Parameter Control**: Manages temperature, ventilation, irrigation, and light according to plant requirements
- **Non-Linear Growth Modeling**: Realistic plant growth with tailored growth rates for each phase
- **Error Simulation**: Random suboptimal conditions to test plant resilience
- **Data Logging**: Comprehensive data collection for later analysis
- **Visualization**: Daily visualizations and summary charts showing plant growth and environmental conditions
- **Animation**: Creates an animation of the entire growth cycle
